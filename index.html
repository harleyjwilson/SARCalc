    <h2>Naismith's Rule - Determination of Possible Search Area</h2>
    <h3>Trip Times</h3>
    <p>
      It is a general rule for calculating trip times for the average walker
      with a medium weight back travelling over flat terrain.
    </p>
    <ul>
      Easy going over open country: 5 km/hour
    </ul>
    <ul>
      Easy scrambling over rocky ground: 3 km/hour
    </ul>
    <ul>
      Rough going (thick scrub, heavy sand): 1 to 1.5 km/hour
    </ul>
    <h3>Difficulty Complications</h3>
    <p>
      When travelling for extended periods or traversing hilly country, the
      search radius needs to be reduced to allow for fatigue and slower travel.
    </p>
    <ul>
      For every 5 hours of walking: subtract the distance travelled in 1 hour
    </ul>
    <ul>
      For every 500m of ascent or 1000m of descent over the estimated distance
      travelled: subtract the distance travelled in 1 hour
    </ul>
